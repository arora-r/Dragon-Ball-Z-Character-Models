When importing characters into unity, you should follow these steps:
  1. Copy the folder of the character you want into the unity project window.
  2. Drag the FBX file into the scene.
  3. Go to the characters prefab settings (Click on the fbx file in the project window).
  4. Go to materials and change the location setting to "Use External Materials (Legacy)".
  5. Then change the naming setting to "Model Name + Model's Material", and click Apply.
  6. In the materials folder in the project window, click on the materials and drag in the corresponding png file to the Albedo section of the material's settings in the inspector.
  7. Once done all the materials your character is good to go!
 
If any problems or questions arise feel free to ask me anything!
